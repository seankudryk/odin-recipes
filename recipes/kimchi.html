            <p class="description-text">Kimchi is a popular Korean fermented cabbage dish that's spicy and slightly sweet. I spent a year in South Korea and fell in love with kimchi! My friend Myong was kind enough to share her recipe and technique with me. Use this kimchi in stir fries or your favorite Korean dishes.</p>
